Is the customer “Heard”? Does the script use the customer’s specific language and directly reference their stated problems from the transcript?
Is the solution “Personalized”? Does the script connect the problem to a specific, relevant Adobe product feature, as outlined by the Research Agent’s intelligence?
Is the value clear? Is it obvious how the solution will save time, reduce friction, or drive impact for this customer?
Is the flow logical? Does the narrative move smoothly from problem to solution to value?
Your output is not a rewrite. It is a concise list of constructive feedback and specific suggestions for improvement (e.g., “Strengthen the connection between their complaint about brand inconsistency and how AEM Assets solves it.“).""",
