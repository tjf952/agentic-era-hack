[10:01 AM] Jordan Lee (VP of Marketing):
 Hey Alex, thanks for joining. I’ve been hearing a lot about Adobe’s Content Supply Chain and GenStudio—excited to dig in.
[10:02 AM] Alex Martinez (Adobe SC):
 Absolutely, Jordan. Great to meet you. I’ve looked into RetailCo’s recent campaigns—your seasonal launches are impressive. Let’s talk about how GenStudio can help scale that even further.
[10:03 AM] Jordan:
 Appreciate that. Honestly, our biggest challenge is content velocity. We’re juggling product drops, influencer assets, and regional variations. It’s a lot.
[10:04 AM] Alex:
 Totally get it. GenStudio was built for exactly that kind of complexity. It centralizes your content creation, connects it to campaign planning, and uses AI to speed up production—especially for retail brands with high-volume needs.
[10:05 AM] Jordan:
 How does it actually work? Is it replacing our creative tools?
[10:06 AM] Alex:
 Not at all. GenStudio integrates with your existing stack—Creative Cloud, Workfront, AEM, even Firefly. Think of it as the command center for your content supply chain. You can plan, create, approve, and publish—all in one flow.
[10:07 AM] Jordan:
 Interesting. We’ve got teams in merchandising, creative, and digital—all working in silos. Can GenStudio help bridge that?
[10:08 AM] Alex:
 Yes, that’s one of its strengths. It gives each team visibility into the full lifecycle. Merchandising can tag product priorities, creative can build modular assets, and digital can pull approved content directly into campaigns.
[10:09 AM] Jordan:
 Modular assets—you mean like reusable templates?
[10:10 AM] Alex:
 Exactly. GenStudio lets you create content blocks—like product shots, promo banners, or lifestyle imagery—that can be reused across channels. AI even suggests variations based on audience or region.
[10:11 AM] Jordan:
 That could save us a ton of time. Right now, we’re recreating assets for every channel.
[10:12 AM] Alex:
 And that’s where reuse rates come in. Retail clients using GenStudio have seen up to 40% increase in content reuse and 30% faster time-to-market.
[10:13 AM] Jordan:
 That’s compelling. What about personalization? We’re trying to get more targeted with our email and social.
[10:14 AM] Alex:
 GenStudio connects with AJO and Marketo, so you can personalize at scale. It tags content with metadata—audience, product, region—and automates delivery based on those attributes.
[10:15 AM] Jordan:
 Love that. Our creative team worries about losing control with automation though.
[10:16 AM] Alex:
 Totally fair. GenStudio doesn’t replace creativity—it enhances it. Creatives still design the core assets, but automation handles the repetitive resizing, tagging, and distribution.
[10:17 AM] Jordan:
 Makes sense. What’s the onboarding like? We’ve got a mix of tech-savvy and old-school folks.
[10:18 AM] Alex:
 We tailor onboarding by persona. For creatives, we focus on Firefly and asset reuse. For ops, it’s workflow automation. For marketers, it’s campaign orchestration. And we offer guided demos and sandbox environments.
[10:19 AM] Jordan:
 Do you have any retail case studies?
[10:20 AM] Alex:
 Yes—one fashion brand reduced their campaign production time by 50% using GenStudio. I’ll send you that along with a demo walkthrough.
[10:21 AM] Jordan:
 Perfect. What’s the pricing model?
[10:22 AM] Alex:
 It’s modular—based on users and integrations. I’ll loop in your Adobe account team to tailor a proposal.
[10:23 AM] Jordan:
 Sounds good. One last thing—how does GenStudio handle approvals? We’ve got a lot of cooks in the kitchen.
[10:24 AM] Alex:
 Workfront handles that beautifully. You can set up approval paths by role, region, or campaign type. GenStudio syncs with it so nothing goes live without the right sign-offs.
[10:25 AM] Jordan:
 That’s huge. We’ve had a few slip-ups lately.
[10:26 AM] Alex:
 GenStudio helps prevent that. Plus, you get full audit trails and version control.
[10:27 AM] Jordan:
 Alright, I’m sold. Let’s set up a deeper dive with my team.
[10:28 AM] Alex:
 I’ll send over a recap, demo links, and a proposed agenda for next week. Looking forward to it!
[10:29 AM] Jordan:
 Thanks, Alex. This was super helpful.
[10:30 AM] Alex:
 My pleasure, Jordan. Talk soon!
