David: “Hi Sarah, thanks again for making the time today. As I mentioned in my email, my goal here isn’t to give you a generic presentation, but really just to listen and understand what’s top of mind for you and your team at Innovate Apparel as you head into the next quarter.”
Sarah: “Hi David, I appreciate that. Honestly, things are... chaotic. We’re growing fast, which is great, but our processes are breaking. To be blunt, our global marketing efforts are a mess.”
David: “I hear that a lot from brands in your position. Can you walk me through what that ‘mess’ looks like in practice? For instance, what happened with your last major campaign?”
Sarah: “Oh, the ‘Spring Collection’ launch? It’s the perfect example. The core campaign was beautiful, created by our central creative team. The problem started when we tried to get it to our regional marketers in Japan, Germany, and Brazil. First off, just finding the assets was a nightmare. We’re using a mix of Dropbox, Google Drive, and some old server. I had our German marketing manager emailing me frantically because he couldn’t find the right logo—he was about to use one from two years ago!”
David: “Okay, so a central source of truth for assets is a major issue right off the bat.”
Sarah: “Exactly. Then we had the launch video. The creative team sent a link, and the feedback process was a total disaster. I got three separate emails from my CMO, the head of product, and our legal counsel, all with conflicting feedback. The CMO just wrote, ‘The pacing feels off in the middle,’ while legal sent a Word doc with a list of timestamps to check that didn’t even line up with the latest version! It was a total time-sink. Our video editor spent half a day just trying to decipher the notes before he could even start making changes.”
David: “So on top of the asset chaos, you have a disconnected and confusing review cycle, especially for video.”
Sarah: “A complete nightmare. But it gets worse. The campaign’s main slogan didn’t translate well for the Brazilian market. They needed to adjust it. But to get a new graphic made with the new text, they had to submit a ticket to our already-overloaded central design team. The turnaround was five days. By then, the initial launch buzz was gone. We completely missed the window.”
David: “So speed and local agility are being blocked by both creative bottlenecks and messy feedback loops.”
Sarah: “Blocked is a gentle way of putting it. It’s killing our momentum. And our regional marketers, who are smart, strategic people, are spending their days in Canva trying to poorly replicate a graphic just to change one line of text. They feel disempowered, and our brand consistency is suffering. The campaign looked different in every region. We have this core strategic goal to create personalized campaigns that are locally relevant, but in reality, we either go slow and miss the market, or we go fast and generic. We can’t seem to do both.”
David: “That’s a powerful way to put it—the conflict between going slow and right vs. fast and generic. So if you could wave a magic wand, what would the ideal process look like for you?”
Sarah: “In an ideal world, our central team would define the brand strategy and create a flexible campaign kit. Everyone could give feedback on the master video in one place, with clear, frame-specific comments. Then, our regional marketers could take that approved kit and—without being design experts—quickly create locally relevant assets that are guaranteed to be on-brand. I want to empower my local teams, but within a framework that protects our brand. I want them to feel heard and trusted.”
David: “That makes perfect sense. Thank you for sharing that, Sarah, it’s incredibly helpful. It sounds like the core challenge isn’t just about assets or tools, but about enabling a workflow that scales global brand control and local market agility. I’m hearing a need for a central asset hub, a consolidated and clear feedback loop for video and creative, and self-service capabilities for marketers, all managed without chaos.”
Sarah: “Yes, that’s it exactly. You’ve nailed it.”
David: “Great. Based on what you’ve described, I strongly believe a personalized demo would be valuable. I can show you how we can directly address this workflow, from central asset management to collaborative review to empowering your regional marketers. How does your calendar look for next Tuesday?”
